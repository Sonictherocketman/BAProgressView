## Overview

BAProgressView is a class for displaying a visual representation of a progress bar in discrete segments. Unlike UIProgressView it does not display the representation of the progress as a bar metric but as a series of discrete indicators. The appearance is generated by a set of customizable images known as trackIndicatorImage, and progressIndicatorImage. While these images are customizable, a set of default images are provided for easy use. 

In accordance with the style of iOS 7 this class also includes a tintColor property. This tint color is blended over the provided trackIndicatorImage and progressIndicatorImage to give a similar appearance to that of native iOS 7 controls. However, the tint color property is generated so that devices running iOS 6.1 may also use the property.

When deciding to use this class in a project there are a few simple steps that must be done. After alloc-init, the next step is to set custom attributes for the frame, tintColor, trackIndicatorImage, and progressIndicatorImage according to the use case. In most cases the system defaults will be enough to satesfy the needs of the project, but the ability to change such properties is provided. The next step is to call the method setProgress: animated: (detailed descriptions for all of these properties and methods is provided below). This method sets the initial progress of the view, and now the only step is to add it to another UIView for display. Keep in mind that a frame CGRect must be provided, as there is no default size given, and this will cause problems during implementation.
